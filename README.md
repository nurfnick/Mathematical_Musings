## A place to store some random programming files

Occasionally I have a great programming idea that I am sure is not as novel as I believe.  I will place them here and forget I ever did it.  Perhaps they can provide future inspiration.

1. The first file I created was a checker for pythagorean triples.  I have a proof that for any odd numer $x$, there is a triple in the form 
$$ x, y, y+1$$
To see this just note that $y= \frac{x^2-1}2$.
